Message Body:
Dear Sir/mdm, 
 
How are you? 
 
We supply N95, KN95, 3ply masks and Thermal cameras for Body Temperature Measurement up to accuracy of Â±0.1?C 
Advantages of thermal imaging detection: 
 
1. Intuitive, efficient and convenient, making users directly "see" the temperature variation. 
2. Thermal condition of different locations for comprehensive analysis, providing more information for judgment 
3. Avoiding judgment errors, reducing labor costs, and discovering poor heat dissipation and hidden trouble points 
4. PC software for data analysis and report output
