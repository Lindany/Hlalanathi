Subject: Why not TALK with your leads?

Message Body:
My name’s Eric and I just found your site hlalanathi.com.

It’s got a lot going for it, but here’s an idea to make it even MORE effective.

Talk With Web Visitor – CLICK HERE http://www.talkwithwebvisitor.com for a live demo now.

Talk With Web Visitor is a software widget that’s works on your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.  It signals you the moment they let you know they’re interested – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re literally looking over your site.

And once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS) conversation… and if they don’t take you up on your offer then, you can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, even just “how you doing?” notes to build a relationship.

CLICK HERE http://www.talkwithwebvisitor.com to discover what Talk With Web Visitor can do for your business.

The difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus a half-hour means you could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Eric
