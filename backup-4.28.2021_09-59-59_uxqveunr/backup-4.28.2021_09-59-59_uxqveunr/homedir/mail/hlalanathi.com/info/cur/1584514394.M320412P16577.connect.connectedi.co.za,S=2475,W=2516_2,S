Message Body:
What antibiotics are prescribed for coronavirus? 
A viral infection is never treated with antibiotics, why I do not know why this misconception took root. Influenza, ARVI - viral infections and they are treated with antiviral drugs: ingavirin, remantadine, Tamiflu and others. Coronavirus is also a viral infection and it should also be treated with antiviral drugs, as well as drugs for symptomatic treatment - anti-inflammatory, for example. There are currently no vaccines from the new Chinese coronavirus. 
 
Antibiotics target bacterial infections. But if a bacterial infection joins a viral disease with or without treatment, then the doctor can prescribe antibiotics, and outside of which, he should. And due to the fact that antibiotics are prescribed when it is not necessary, when it will be necessary - they may not work.
